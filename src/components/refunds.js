            In case of no-show or unutilized bookings, User shall be required to make requests for any valid and applicable refunds, as per Vendors’ policies, within 90 days from the travel date. No refund would be payable for any requests made after the expiry of 90 days of travel date/ check-in as
             aforementioned and all unclaimed amounts for such no-show or unutilized bookings shall accordingly be deemed to have been forfeited. The refund shall be processed within 15-20 working days from the date of the cancellation request, after receiving back to back refund from the concerned Vendor. If Travel Ooty has received the payment through a valid credit card, then the same will be refunded to User’s credit card. In case User avails to book any of the Services offered by the Vendor and is, thereafter, not contactable on the contact details provided, then the tour reservation selected by User will stand cancelled and Travel Ooty or the Vendor would not be liable for any charges/expenses incurred by User, either directly or indirectly in this regard.
